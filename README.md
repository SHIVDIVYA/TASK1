OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:GAME DEVELOPMENT
The code implements a simple text-based adventure game with three main actions: exploring rooms, checking the score, and quitting the game. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

Key Features:

1. Main Menu:

Displays the available actions (e for exploring, s for showing the score, and q for quitting).

Handles invalid input gracefully.



2. Room Exploration:

Randomly determines one of three events when a room is explored:

Fighting an enemy.

Finding a treasure.

Encountering an empty room.




3. Enemy Encounter:

Simulates a fight with random attack values for both the player and the enemy.

The player wins if their attack is equal to or higher than the enemy's.

Defeat ends the game.



4. Treasure:

Randomly generates a treasure value and adds it to the player's score.



5. Game Over:

The game ends if the player chooses to quit (q) or is defeated in a fight.




Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Add Replayability:

Prompt the player to restart the game after losing or quitting.



2. Enhanced Combat System:

Introduce health points, defense, and special attacks to make combat more engaging.



3. Room Descriptions:

Add more flavor text to describe the rooms, making exploration more immersive.



4. Input Validation:

Handle edge cases where the player enters invalid or unexpected input (e.g., numeric characters).



5. Persistent High Score:

Save the player's highest score in a file to compare across sessions.



6. Additional Features:

Introduce items, puzzles, or NPCs for interaction.

Add different types of enemies and treasures with unique properties.[output (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18309858/output.1.pdf)
